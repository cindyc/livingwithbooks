What can you do in a year? Well, if you set your mind to it, you could do anything you want to do. These writers spent one year to challenge the mental limits and accomplished the near impossible:



###### Become the U.S. Memory Champion


![Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art of Science of Remembering Everything](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51emzVxdvWL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

<i>Moonwalking with Einstein</i> recounts Joshua Foer's yearlong quest to improve his memory under the tutelage of top "mental athletes." He draws on cutting-edge research, a surprising cultural history of remembering, and venerable tricks of the mentalist's trade to transform our understanding of human memory.

<strong>Why did he do it?</strong>

Joshua is a science journalist, one of his trips took him to the Weightlifting Hall of Fame and Museum and in front of the photos of the strongest man in the world, he wondered how it would be if the world's strongest person meets the world's smartest person. After some googling he found the smartest person, or the man who possesses the most freakish memory -- Ben Pridmore, who can memorize the 1,528 random digits in an hour, or the order of a shuffled deck of playing cards in 32 seconds, or 50,000 of pi.

The author has the average memory at best, he regularly forgot where he left his car keys, or his girlfriend's birthday, or his friends' phone numbers, or a book on the shelf that he has read or not. Everyday there are more facts to remember, and there are more to forget. His mind kept going back to what Ben Pridmore said in an interview: "It's all about technique and understanding how the memory works, anyone could do it, really".

A couple of weeks later Joshua observed the U.S. Memory Championship, watched the "mental athletes" compete in the near impossible feats of memorizing the pages of random words, photographs of 99 random head shots, a thousand random digits, and a 50-line poem, and a shuffled decks of playing cards within 5 mins. What really shocked him though, its' after the competition, when he asked the grand master of the championship if he is blessed with photographic memory, the answer shocked him:
<blockquote>I asked Ed Cooke, a young grand master from England who had come to U.S. event as spring training for that summer's World Championship (since he was a non-American, his scores couldn't be counted in the U.S. contest), when he first realized he was a savant.

"Oh, I'm not a savant," he said, chuckling.

"Photographic memory?" I asked.

He chuckled again. "Photographic memory is a detestable myth, " he said, "Doesn't exist. In fact, memory is quite average. All of us here have average memories."</blockquote>
That begins Joshua's yearlong quest to interview the mental athletes, to research ancient the mnemonic techniques, to train 3 hours a day and 6 days a week under the experts, and eventually, to become the champion of the U.S. Memory Championship.

<strong>Why I liked it: </strong>

The author documented fascinating accounts of the history and science of ancient mnemonic techniques like the memory palace documented by Romans, the <a title="Major System" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system" target="_blank">Major System</a>, the <a title="PAO System" href="http://mt.artofmemory.com/wiki/Person-Action-Object_(PAO)_System" target="_blank">PAO System</a> to the modern Mind Mapping techniques developed by his coach <a title="Tony Buzan" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Buzan" target="_blank">Tony Buzan</a>. The characters he mentioned in his memory research are also amazing: from the memory savants like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Mind-Mnemonist-Little-Memory/dp/0674576225" target="_blank">the man who never forgets</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek" target="_blank">Kim Peek who inspired movie "Rain Man"</a>, to the men and women in various age, background and "hygiene upkeep" who trained for the ultimate mental athletic competition. The entire book is a fun read, travels through time and in and out of the human brains, it never gets boring.

###### Strive to Know It All


![The Know-It-All: One Man's Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person --A. J. Jacobs](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QVZWXV3BL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

<i>The Know-It-All</i> chronicles NPR contributor A.J. Jacobs's hilarious, enlightening, and seemingly impossible quest to read the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> from A to Z.

<strong>Why did he do it? </strong>

A.J used to feel pretty smart in his high school and college days, but after graduation, and years of working for Entertainment Weekly and spending time getting the minutia of movies celebrities into his head, not so much anymore:
<blockquote>I was actually considered somewhat cerebral. I brought D.H. Lawrence novels on vacations, earnestly debated the fundamentals of Marxism, peppered my conversation with words like "albeit". I knew my stuff. Then, in the years since graduating college, I began a long, slow slide into dumbness. At age thirty-five, I've become embarrassingly ignorant. If things continue at this rate, by my fortieth birthday, I'll be spending my days watching Wheel of Fortune and drooling into a bucket.</blockquote>
A.J. has been toying with the idea of reading the Britannica for years. At this age of extreme specialization, he wants to be the last guy in America to have all general knowledge. This was also inspired by his overachieving father, who is brilliant attorney who loves learning, has written numerous books, read Britannica to mid-Bs himself. With the ambition to become the smartest person in the world, under the skepticism of his wife, friends and his unconvincing father, he placed the $1400 order of the leatherette volumes of Britannica, and therefore began the nearly impossible year-long quest of reading all 32 volumes of it.

<strong style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">Why I liked it: </strong>

<span style="font-style:inherit;font-weight:inherit;line-height:1.625;">It may look like he's only person in the world who takes on such slow and impractical way to acquire knowledge, I happen to think this is the most luxurious way of spending one's time learning -- just read for the sake of wanting to learn, letter by letter, volume by volume, without distractions. At this digital age, most of us don't want to finish reading one single article on the web, before pressing Ctrl+F to zoom in on the paragraph that answers one question, or promptly share it on the social media with friends who won't bother to read the whole thing either.  Besides, a lot of thing we read on the web have to be fact checked and reference checked, with Britannica, we don't need to, after all, it's the Encyclopedia, it's the highest authority of knowledge.</span>

His writing is hilarious. Recounting the facts he learned from the Encyclopedia would have been very boring, the author makes the entire reading experience hilarious by intertwining the definitions and stories in the Encyclopedia with the happenings in his life. From the book description: "On his journey he stumbles upon some of the strangest, funniest, and most profound facts about every topic under the sun, all while battling fatigue, ridicule, and the paralyzing fear that attends his first real-life responsibility -- the impending birth of his first child.".

Also check out the other things he did in a year, hilarious books too:
