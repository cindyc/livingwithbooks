#### The Walk 

Selections from one of my reading sprees. These 3 books are about the lone walks in the wilderness. They are explorer's diaries that take us to experience the places, people, the danger and the self discovery through the journey. Be it an expedition that no human ever attempted; a spiritual journey to find oneself; or a discovery trip of the land we are living on, these books take us one step at a time.

British explorer Ed Stafford walked the entire Amazon river on foot, without using a motor, a boat or even the flow of the river to propel him. The expedition is first time anyone walk the entire Amazon river on foot, and is recognized for Guinness World Record.

<strong>Time</strong>: Apri 2008 - Aug 2010 (860 Days)

<strong>Distance</strong>: 4000 Miles. The entire Amazon river, from furthest source of the river in Pacific Coast of Peru to the mouth to Atlantic Ocean in Brazil. Countries: Peru, Columbia, Brazil

<strong>Supplies:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Tents and backpacks</li>
	<li>Inflatable raft packs (partially sponsored by Alpacka Raft company in Canada)</li>
	<li>Tailored medical kit (with extensive trauma care training and remote medics on call), sponsored by Ex-Med. The company also provided them insurance and a squad team that can lift him out of the jungle within 16 hours.</li>
	<li>Basic Macbook (the white one) with spare batteries (x2) and power cable. 4 six-foot solar rolls and rechargeable batteries, satellite phone. The laptop and satellite phone are for updating his blog along the trip and get connected with his friends. Using the solar rolls to charge batteries is a challenge when deep in the jungle, as there is  All these gears have added considerable weight to the backpack that he has to carry through out the journey</li>
	<li>Food and water: carrying 10 days supply in the backpack is a big challenge. And making food supply last till the destination is essential to survival in the jungle, at one point Stafford and his guide had 3 days food supply of rice, salt, instance raman noodle, and small amount of monosodium glutamate(MSG) that has to last 2 weeks.</li>
	<li>Machete 18'' (x2), fishing kit.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Partners:</strong>

Stafford's friend and work colleague Luke walked with him at the beginning of the expedition, but he decided to go home after 3 months. In Peru Stafford had various local guides and native lads (with donkeys occasionally) to walk with him to the next village or destination. At the "Red Zone", he recruited "Cho", who walked with him for 2 years to till the completion of the journey.

<strong>Dangers:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The Amazon river has a very shallow basin and is prone to enormous flooding, the river regularly burst its banks and water enters the forest up to 70 kilometers an hour from its main channel.</li>
	<li>Languages: He needs to speak basic Spanish(Peru) and Portuguese(Brazil). There are more than 30 languages spoken in Peru alone. Language skills have been a challenge to the explorer, and he has some difficult moments with the guides because of the language barrier.</li>
	<li>The "Red Zone": The Red Zone is the drug trafficking center of Peru. The "narcos" does huge amount of drug processing trafficking in the jungles along Amazon river, and are equipped with the machine guns, GPS, more advanced than police. If any outsiders accidentally walks into one of their drug processing plants, they'll get killed immediately. On the other hand the "nativos" (Local Indigenous Amerindians) do not trust the "gringos", because the exploits of the oil companies. Stafford and his guides have frequently been inspected, questioned and closely watched when passing the villages.</li>
	<li>Wildlife: Piranhas, which he was lucky enough never got bite, caimans and anacondas, snakes. And mosquitos, millions of them outside the net.</li>
</ul>
<strong>The finish:</strong>

After 860 days, 8,000 kilometers, 200,000 mosquito bites, under the watch and flash light of media and friends, Stafford and Cho walked to beach of Atlantic Ocean.

<strong>Quotes:</strong>
<blockquote>For this to be a Guinness World Record we had to be scrupulously strict. We would walk 100 per cent of the journey and never use a motor, a sail or even the flow of the river to propel us. Clearly we would have to cross bodies of water, and for that we would be in boats, but we knew from the outset that every meter of each crossing should be paddled by hand to make the journey truly human-powered.</blockquote>

Walking on ice covered trail at risk of falling off the cliff.

<strong>The finish:</strong>

Strayed reached the "Bridge of the Gods" that's connecting the Oregon and Washington borders.

<strong>Quotes:</strong>
<blockquote>It was all unknown to me then, as I sat on that white bench on the day I finished my hike. Everything except the fact that I didn't have to know. That is was enough to trust that what I'd done was true. To understand its meaning without yet being able to say precisely what it was, like all those lines from The Dream of a Common Language that had run through my nights and days. To believe that I didn't need to reach with my bare hands anymore. To know what seeing the fish beneath the surface of the water was enough,. That is was everything. It was my life -- like all lives, mysterious adn irrevocable and sacred. So very close, so very present, so very belonging to me.

How wild it was, to let it be.</blockquote>

In 1973, Jenkins was 19 years old and just broke out of a marriage. He wanted to leave his hometown Greenwich, Connecticut for a while. He was also upset by the things heard on the news -- about the Vietnam war, about the South, about the industrial pollution in America and so many other concerns, he wanted to walk to rewaken this faith in himself and his country.

<strong>Time</strong>: Jul 1973 -- Nov 1975, 2 years

<strong>Distance</strong>: 2,000 miles. Alfred, New York to New Orleans, Louisiana. His second book, "The Walk West" covers the second part of the walk from Louisiana to Colorado).

<strong>Supplies</strong>:

- Backpack, tent, sleeping bag, backpack, down jacket, parka...He found the best backpacks and sleeping bags he can find and the most comfortable shoes to survive the 2000 mile walk, the blizzards and the rattlesnakes.

- Couple hundred dollars in traveler checks, very little cash. If he's running out of cash, he would find a job and settle down until he earn enough to go on the walk.

<strong>Partners:</strong>

Jenkins was accompanied by his loyal dog Cooper, but Cooper died in a car accident in Tennessee.

<strong>Dangers:</strong>

The winter coldness and blizzards while walking in Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina. He had to keep moving at all time, stopping or taking a break during the winter storm would mean imminent death.

<strong>The finish:</strong>

The book has an spiritual and emotional ending. At New Orleans, he completed the first part of his walk, and also started a new chapter of his life.

<strong>Quotes:</strong>
<blockquote>You see, this walk across America was not some spur-of-the-moment decision. I didn't one day throw a bunch of underwear, socks and clothes into a backpack, whistle for Cooper while he lay fat and sassy under a shade tree, and take off. I wouldn't have made the one-day walk to the Pennsylvania border like that. This walk has been brewing for a long time. Growing up in Greenwich, Connecticut, had a lot to do with the building pressure that led to this personal search and walk. ...

New York City is a place to grow up. Denver is a place to grow up. Orrville, Alabama, is a place to grow up and so is Thibodaux, Louisiana. These are all places where people are born, places where people die, and Greenwich was my place to be born and grow up. My problem was that I thought all towns in America were just like Greenwich.</blockquote>
